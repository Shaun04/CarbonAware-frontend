## Contribution
This extension is currently only compatible with Firefox browsers. However, with some adjustments to the manifest file, it can be made to work on other browsers as well. While efforts to adapt it for use on Chrome are still in the early stages, contributions to this project would be greatly appreciated. Links to resources for getting started with Chrome extensions can be found below. Please feel free to contribute to making this extension work on Chrome and don't forget to submit a pull request with the changes. <br>
